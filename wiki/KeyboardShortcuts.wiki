 * *ctrl-u* - toggle the update area
 * *ctrl-r* - add @screenname of the selected Tweets user to the update textbox
 * *ctrl-q* - Quit. Exit. Vamoose.
 * *ctrl-o* - not enabled. Open the options dialog. I think the show options code may need to be refactored a little before this is enabled.
 * *F5* - refresh. It seemed best to stick with IE/Firefox's refresh key.
