==#1 Why did you build Twitter?==

I built Twitter for several reasons. First, to hone my technical and design skills with WPF.  Secondly, to create a kickass Twitter client for Windows. And last but not least, to share with the community on how to build desktop applications with WPF.

==#2 What did you use to build Witty?==

Witty was developed using [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx Microsoft Visual Studio] and [http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/overview.aspx?key=blend Expression Blend]. Witty is programmed in C#.

==#3 How often does the recent timeline refresh?==

Currently the refresh interval is set to 2 minutes. Witty v0.1.5 will allow this value to be configurable.
