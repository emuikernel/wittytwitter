==#1 Why did you build Witty?==

I started Witty for several reasons. First, to hone my technical and design skills with WPF.  Secondly, to create a kickass Twitter client for Windows. And last but not least, to share with the community on how to build desktop applications with WPF.

There are several twitter clients done with Adobe AIR. Why not make one available in WPF?

==#2 What did you use to build Witty?==

Witty was developed using [http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/default.aspx Microsoft Visual Studio] and [http://www.microsoft.com/expression/products/overview.aspx?key=blend Expression Blend]. Witty is programmed in C#.

==#3 How often does the recent timeline refresh?==

Currently the refresh interval is set to 2 minutes. In Witty v0.1.5 and later, this value is configurable.

==#4 I cannot build Witty.sln in Visual Studio==

Make sure you have the Visual Studio 2005 extensions for .NET Framework 3.0 installed. http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=F54F5537-CC86-4BF5-AE44-F5A1E805680D&displaylang=en
