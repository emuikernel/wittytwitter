If you want to fire off a Tweet, click the Update bar at the bottom of Witty.

The Update/Reply window will help you call out other Tweeps you're following via auto complete. After you type the @ character Witty will start looking through the list of people you follow and suggest matches to you. Use the Up/Down arrows to cycle through matching items. The Tab key will accept your current selection.

Interacting with the activity stream in Witty is simple. Just right-click on Witty and choose one of the options on the context menu.

The context menu options are fairly self-explanatory, but here's a short blurb on the items:

* Reply* Send an "@" reply to the Tweep whose message you right-clicked on.

* Send Direct Message* Send a Direct Message (private Tweet) to the person you right-clicked on.

* Delete* Delete a Tweet. Only works on your own Tweets.

* Retweet* Copies the selected Tweet into a new update from you -- and prefaces the message with "retweet."

* Refresh* Pulls in the latest traffic from Twitter.

* Clear All Tweets* Clears Witty of all Tweets.

* Temporarily Ignore User* Also called the Hot Head filter. Ignores Tweets from this person for an hour. (An hour's hardwired in. Sorry. Submit a patch if you'd like it configurable.)

You'll see new Tweets flashing up on your screen occasionally. The frequency of updates is controlled in the Option panel, as is the duration of the pop up notifications.

You can right-click on any of these update messages to reply or direct message the Tweep sending the message.

Witty also helps you out with automatic URL shortening. You can select a number of different URL shortening services in the General tab of the [OptionShots Options] page. Witty will automatically shorten URLs for you when the content of your Update/Reply window is over 140 characters.

The resulting Tweet will display the shortened URL.
