The context menu options are fairly self-explanatory, but here's a short blurb on the items:

* Reply* Send an "@" reply to the Tweep whose message you right-clicked on.

* Send Direct Message* Send a Direct Message (private Tweet) to the person you right-clicked on.

* Delete* Delete a Tweet. Only works on your own Tweets.

* Retweet* Copies the selected Tweet into a new update from you -- and prefaces the message with "retweet."

* Refresh* Pulls in the latest traffic from Twitter.

* Clear All Tweets* Clears Witty of all Tweets.

* Temporarily Ignore User* Also called the Hot Head filter. Ignores Tweets from this person for a short time.

You'll see new Tweets flashing up on your screen occasionally. The frequency of updates is controlled in the Option panel, as is the duration of the pop up notifications.

You can right-click on any of these update messages to reply or direct message the Tweep sending the message.
